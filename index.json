They induce chromatin reorganization that is associated with altered cellular morphology. However, there is a lack of comprehensive characterization of VPA-induced changes of nuclear size and shape. Here, we quantify 3D nuclear morphology of primary human astrocyte cells treated with VPA over time (hence, 4D). We compared volumetric and surface-based representations and identified seven features that jointly discriminate between normal and treated cells with 85% accuracy on day 7. From day 3, treated nuclei were more elongated and flattened and then continued to morphologically diverge from controls over time, becoming larger and more irregular. On day 7, most of the size and shape descriptors demonstrated significant differences between treated and untreated cells, including a 24% increase in volume and 6% reduction in extent (shape regularity) for treated nuclei. Overall, we show that 4D morphometry can capture how chromatin reorganization modulates the size and shape of the nucleus over time. These nuclear structural alterations may serve as a biomarker for histone (de-)acetylation events and provide insights into mechanisms of astrocytes-to-neurons reprogramming.","tags":null,"title":"Valproic Acid-Induced Changes of 4D Nuclear Morphology in Astrocyte Cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin D.

In particular, machine learning is concerned with the development and applications of algorithms that can recognize patterns in data and use them for predictive modeling. Artificial neural networks are a particular class of machine learning algorithms and models that evolved into what is now described as deep learning. Given the computational advances made in the last decade, deep learning can now be applied to massive data sets and in innumerable contexts. Therefore, deep learning has become its own subfield of machine learning. In the context of biological research, it has been increasingly used to derive novel insights from high-dimensional biological data. To make the biological applications of deep learning more accessible to scientists who have some experience with machine learning, we solicited input from a community of researchers with varied biological and deep learning interests. These individuals collaboratively contributed to this manuscript's writing using the GitHub version control platform and the Manubot manuscript generation toolset. The goal was to articulate a practical, accessible, and concise set of guidelines and suggestions to follow when using deep learning. In the course of our discussions, several themes became clear: the importance of understanding and applying machine learning fundamentals as a baseline for utilizing deep learning, the necessity for extensive model comparisons with careful evaluation, and the need for critical thought in interpreting results generated by deep learning, among others.","tags":null,"title":"Ten Quick Tips for Deep Learning in Biology","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our new collaboratively written preprint \u0026ldquo;Ten Quick Tips for Deep Learning in Biology\u0026rdquo; is now available on arXiv.\n","date":1621555200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621555200,"objectID":"d352d8d3910b943585cedd4161bbd40e","permalink":"https://alxndrkalinin.github.io/post/2021-05-21-10tips/","publishdate":"2021-05-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2021-05-21-10tips/","section":"post","summary":"We provide some suggestions to keep in mind as you embark on a biological deep learning application.","tags":null,"title":"New preprint \"Ten Quick Tips for Deep Learning in Biology\"","type":"post"},{"authors":["Roman Solovyev","Alexandr A.

Brain vasculature dysfunctions such as stalled blood flow in cerebral capillaries are associated with cognitive decline and pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease. Recent advances in imaging technology enabled generation of high-quality 3D images that can be used to visualize stalled blood vessels. However, localization of stalled vessels in 3D images is often required as the first step for downstream analysis, which can be tedious, time-consuming and error-prone, when done manually. Here, we describe a deep learning-based approach for automatic detection of stalled capillaries in brain images based on 3D convolutional neural networks. Our networks employed custom 3D data augmentations and were used weight transfer from pre-trained 2D models for initialization. We used an ensemble of several 3D models to produce the winning submission to the Clog Loss: Advance Alzheimer's Research with Stall Catchers machine learning competition that challenged the participants with classifying blood vessels in 3D image stacks as stalled or flowing. In this setting, our approach outperformed other methods and demonstrated state-of-the-art results, achieving 0.85 Matthews correlation coefficient, 85% sensitivity, and 99.3% specificity.

However, it still remains a challenging problem, for which performance improvements can potentially benefit diagnosis and other clinical practice outcomes. In this chapter, we consider two applications of multiple deep convolutional neural networks to medical image segmentation. First, we describe angiodysplasia lesion segmentation from wireless capsule endoscopy videos. Angiodysplasia is the most common vascular lesion of the gastrointestinal tract in the general population and is important to detect as it may indicate the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding and/or anemia. As a baseline, we consider the U-Net model and then we demonstrate further performance improvements by using different deep architectures with ImageNet pre-trained encoders. In the second example, we apply these models to semantic segmentation of robotic instruments in surgical videos. Segmentation of instruments in the vicinity of surgical scenes is a challenging problem that is important for intraoperative guidance that can help the decision-making process. We achieve highly competitive performance for binary as well as for multi-class instrument segmentation. In both applications, we demonstrate that networks that employ ImageNet pre-trained encoders consistently outperform the U-Net architecture trained from scratch.","tags":null,"title":"Medical image segmentation using deep neural networks with pre-trained encoders","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our new book chapter with Vladimir I.

In computer vision, image augmentations have become a common implicit regularization technique to combat overfitting in deep learning models and are ubiquitously used to improve performance. While most deep learning frameworks implement basic image transformations, the list is typically limited to some variations of flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping. Moreover, image processing speed varies in existing image augmentation libraries. We present Albumentations, a fast and flexible open source library for image augmentation with many various image transform operations available that is also an easy-to-use wrapper around other augmentation libraries. We discuss the design principles that drove the implementation of Albumentations and give an overview of the key features and distinct capabilities.

Histopathological cellularity assessment of residual tumors in post-surgical tissues is used to analyze a tumor's response to a therapy. Correct cellularity assessment increases the chances of getting an appropriate treatment and facilitates the patient's survival. In current clinical practice, tumor cellularity is manually estimated by pathologists; this process is tedious and prone to errors or low agreement rates between assessors. In this work, we evaluated three strong novel Deep Learning-based approaches for automatic assessment of tumor cellularity from post-treated breast surgical specimens stained with hematoxylin and eosin. We validated the proposed methods on the BreastPathQ SPIE challenge dataset that consisted of 2395 image patches selected from whole slide images acquired from 64 patients. Compared to expert pathologist scoring, our best performing method yielded the Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.69 (vs. 0.42 previously known in literature) and the intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.89 (vs. 0.83).

In this study, the ALS disease progression is measured by the change of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) score over time. The study aims to provide clinical decision support for timely forecasting of the ALS trajectory as well as accurate and reproducible computable phenotypic clustering of participants. Patient data are extracted from DREAM-Phil Bowen ALS Prediction Prize4Life Challenge data, most of which are from the Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials Database (PRO-ACT) archive. We employed model-based and model-free machine-learning methods to predict the change of the ALSFRS score over time. Using training and testing data we quantified and compared the performance of different techniques. We also used unsupervised machine learning methods to cluster the patients into separate computable phenotypes and interpret the derived subcohorts. Direct prediction of univariate clinical outcomes based on model-based (linear models) or model-free (machine learning based techniques – random forest and Bayesian adaptive regression trees) was only moderately successful. The correlation coefficients between clinically observed changes in ALSFRS scores relative to the model-based/model-free predicted counterparts were 0.427 (random forest) and 0.545(BART). The reliability of these results were assessed using internal statistical cross validation and well as external data validation. Unsupervised clustering generated very reliable and consistent partitions of the patient cohort into four computable phenotypic subgroups. These clusters were explicated by identifying specific salient clinical features included in the PRO-ACT archive that discriminate between the derived subcohorts. There are differences between alternative analytical methods in forecasting specific clinical phenotypes. Although predicting univariate clinical outcomes may be challenging, our results suggest that modern data science strategies are useful in clustering patients and generating evidence-based ALS hypotheses about complex interactions of multivariate factors. Predicting univariate clinical outcomes using the PRO-ACT data yields only marginal accuracy (about 70%). However, unsupervised clustering of participants into sub-groups generates stable, reliable and consistent (exceeding 95%) computable phenotypes whose explication requires interpretation of multivariate sets of features.","tags":null,"title":"Model-Based and Model-Free Techniques for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Diagnostic Prediction and Patient Clustering","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1562284800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562284800,"objectID":"f1980382da2f3a641f0f0fdcd9c0b3d8","permalink":"https://alxndrkalinin.github.io/talk/2019-issondl-segmentation/","publishdate":"2019-07-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-issondl-segmentation/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Recent Advances in Biomedical Image Segmentation Using Deep Learning","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Roman Solovyev","Alexander Kustov","Dmitry Telpukhov","Vladimir Rukhlov","Alexandr Kalinin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548633600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548633600,"objectID":"367ed8dbec2e314ee7822245955bd7c2","permalink":"https://alxndrkalinin.github.io/publication/2019-ieee-fpga/","publishdate":"2019-01-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-ieee-fpga/","section":"publication","summary":"Modern mobile neural networks with a reduced number of weights and parameters do a good job with image classification tasks, but even they may be too complex to be implemented in an FPGA for video processing tasks.

However, dimensionality of imaging data, together with a great variability of nuclear shapes, presents challenges for 3D morphological analysis. Thus, there is a compelling need for robust 3D nuclear morphometric techniques to carry out population-wide analysis. We propose a new approach that combines modeling, analysis, and interpretation of morphometric characteristics of cell nuclei and nucleoli in 3D. We used robust surface reconstruction that allows accurate approximation of 3D object boundary. Then, we computed geometric morphological measures characterizing the form of cell nuclei and nucleoli. Using these features, we compared over 450 nuclei with about 1,000 nucleoli of epithelial and mesenchymal prostate cancer cells, as well as 1,000 nuclei with over 2,000 nucleoli from serum-starved and proliferating fibroblast cells. Classification of sets of 9 and 15 cells achieved accuracy of 95.4% and 98%, respectively, for prostate cancer cells, and 95% and 98% for fibroblast cells. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine these methods for 3D nuclear shape modeling and morphometry into a highly parallel pipeline workflow for morphometric analysis of thousands of nuclei and nucleoli in 3D.","tags":null,"title":"3D Shape Modeling for Cell Nuclear Morphological Analysis and Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gen Zheng","Alexandr A.

We observed the rotational motion of the nucleus in Caco-2 cells in vitro that appears to be driven by actomyosin network prior to the formation of a differentiated confluent epithelium. Caco-2 cell monolayer preparations demonstrated 2D patterns consistent with Allan Turing's \"gene morphogen\" hypothesis based on live cell imaging analysis of apical tight junctions indicating the actomyosin meshwork. Caco-2 cells in 3D culture are frequently used as a model to study 3D epithelial morphogenesis involving symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions. Differentiation of Caco-2 cells in vitro demonstrated similarity to intestinal enterocyte differentiation along the human colon crypt axis. We observed rotational 3D patterns consistent with gene morphogens during Caco-2 cell differentiation. Single- to multi-cell ring/torus-shaped genomes were observed that were similar to complex fractal Turing patterns extending from a rotating torus centre in a spiral pattern consistent with gene morphogen motif. Rotational features of the epithelial cells may contribute to well-described differentiation from stem cells to the luminal colon epithelium along the crypt axis.

We find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize or definitively resolve any of these problems, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even when improvement over a previous baseline has been modest, we have seen signs that deep learning methods may speed or aid human investigation. More work is needed to address concerns related to interpretability and how to best model each problem.

Russia has a much less storied history with EHR, but Minister of Health of the Russian Federation, Veronika Skvortsova, recently announced the Ministry’s aim to universalize EHR access to improve patient care.

We suggest two main practices that can augment the partnership: (1) the equitable valuation for, and open sharing of, best practices in public-private relationship management, including resource allocation, method regulation, and the financial support of businesses; (2) a science and technology transfer that can foster the adoption of EHRs, which can directly help patients as system benefactors.

To demonstrate how this platform can be used to integrate a number of data management, interactive visualization, and analysis tools, we implement an example application for simple VA tasks including raw data input and representation, interactive visualization and analysis.","tags":null,"title":"SOCRAT Platform Design: A Web Architecture for Interactive Visual Analytics Applications","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1487203200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1487203200,"objectID":"a6c7ff3830041396a31cac42f709121d","permalink":"https://alxndrkalinin.github.io/talk/2017-tt-cnn/","publishdate":"2017-02-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2017-tt-cnn/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Convolutional Neural Networks for Biomedical Image Analysis","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1478908800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1478908800,"objectID":"61ea3f004103d5e808c8efb5919f35dc","permalink":"https://alxndrkalinin.github.io/talk/2016-a2dlearn/","publishdate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2016-a2dlearn/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Deep Learning Year in Review 2016: Computer Vision Perspective","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Syed S Husain","Alexandr Kalinin","Anh Truong","Ivo D Dinov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1437091200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1437091200,"objectID":"6998716dba6ef7030043c22fd9e27e98","permalink":"https://alxndrkalinin.github.io/publication/2015-socr-dashboard/","publishdate":"2015-07-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-socr-dashboard/","section":"publication","summary":"Introduction: Intuitive formulation of informative and computationally-efficient queries on big and complex datasets present a number of challenges. As data collection is increasingly streamlined and ubiquitous, data exploration, discovery and analytics get considerably harder. Exploratory querying of heterogeneous and multi-source information is both difficult and necessary to advance our knowledge about the world around us. Research design: We developed a mechanism to integrate dispersed multi-source data and service the mashed information via human and machine interfaces in a secure, scalable manner. This process facilitates the exploration of subtle associations between variables, population strata, or clusters of data elements, which may be opaque to standard independent inspection of the individual sources. This a new platform includes a device agnostic tool (Dashboard webapp, http://socr.umich.edu/HTML5/Dashboard/) for graphical querying, navigating and exploring the multivariate associations in complex heterogeneous datasets. Results: The paper illustrates this core functionality and service-oriented infrastructure using healthcare data (e.g., US data from the 2010 Census, Demographic and Economic surveys, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Center for Medicare Services) as well as Parkinson’s Disease neuroimaging data. Both the back-end data archive and the front-end dashboard interfaces are continuously expanded to include additional data elements and new ways to customize the human and machine interactions. Conclusions: A client-side data import utility allows for easy and intuitive integration of user-supplied datasets. This completely open-science framework may be used for exploratory analytics, confirmatory analyses, meta-analyses, and education and training purposes in a wide variety of fields.","tags":null,"title":"SOCR data dashboard: an integrated big data archive mashing medicare, labor, census and econometric information","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivo D.

There are uncountably many probability distributions. However, a few dozen families of distributions are commonly defined and are frequently used in practice for problem solving, experimental applications, and theoretical studies. In this paper, we present a new computational and graphical infrastructure, the Distributome, which facilitates the discovery, exploration and application of diverse spectra of probability distributions. The extensible Distributome infrastructure provides interfaces for (human and machine) traversal, search, and navigation of all common probability distributions. It also enables distribution modeling, applications, investigation of inter-distribution relations, as well as their analytical representations and computational utilization. The entire Distributome framework is designed and implemented as an open-source, community-built, and Internet-accessible infrastructure. It is portable, extensible and compatible with HTML5 and Web2.0 standards (http://Distributome.org). We demonstrate two types of applications of the probability Distributome resources: computational research and science education. The Distributome tools may be employed to address five complementary computational modeling applications (simulation, data analysis and inference, model-fitting, examination of the analytical, mathematical and computational properties of specific probability distributions, and exploration of the inter-distributional relations). Many high school and college science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses may be enriched by the use of modern pedagogical approaches and technology-enhanced methods. The Distributome resources provide enhancements for blended STEM education by improving student motivation, augmenting the classical curriculum with interactive webapps, and overhauling the learning assessment protocols.","tags":null,"title":"Probability Distributome: a web computational infrastructure for exploring the properties, interrelations, and applications of probability distributions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandr A.
